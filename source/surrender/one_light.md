# One Light

I watched dawn this morning
in her rose-coloured slip
sliding across dark sea.

Later, vervet monkeys joined in
as I ate breakfast on our balcony,
sitting in the date palms
to share a simple meal
and remind me that we
are never alone:
it's all one.

One golden rose,
lighting the whole horizon.
