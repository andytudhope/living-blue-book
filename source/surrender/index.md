"this hole of light in the light, the puzzled birds swerving around it." — Jane Hirschfield

"For once we have observed the divine transcendent beauty and majesty in creation, we wish to remain in that state. The truth is that we are already in that unified state, but it is up to us to remain conscious of it. This is the choice given to us." — Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri
