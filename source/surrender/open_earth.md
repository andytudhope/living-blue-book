# Open Earth

Here is my praise for the pattern
which winds it seamless way
between our separate worlds,
or so it seems until you learn 
to ask permission.

Today, it was a cat with a green collar
and bell I had to bow before, before being
allowed to fold this self up and die,
feeling deeply the complete lack of difference
between what is in the grave and what presses
its forehead into growing grass.

Carry it wisely while away
from home, young child:
here for a single moment
to wonder in your limited ways
at the multiversal imagination
of One.
