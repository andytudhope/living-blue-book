# Gathering

All these days of dispersion
for two minutes of seeing clouds
without me in the way.

In truth, I would give
all the years of this life
for those two minutes,
such was the mercy
that unfolded in this empty space
splayed out on a rock,
still intent - despite all that
has been washed away -
to feel truly the deep sea.

Nothing is an accident;
everything is made
by the most wonderful chance.
