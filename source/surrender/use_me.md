# Use Me

"I do not ask to see.
I do not ask to know.
I ask only to be used."

---

No sight or sound do I seek,
just a few simple lines
about how a sodium lamp 
turned a shower of leaves golden,
all of them singing grace
in the early evening freshness,
and how none of it was for me:
utterly forgotten by this longing heart
who has taken up remembrance.
