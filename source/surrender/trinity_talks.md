# Trinity Talks

"O you who believe, do not say, 'Listen to us', but say, 'Observe us', and you listen." â€” [Qur'an](https://quran.com/68) 2:104

---

By the pen
and what this dark angel inscribed
that caused us to come together:
charming, beautiful and strange
to speak what can't be truly spoken;
the tranquil soul content, formed 
via sculpting negative space, 
revealing a rhythmic submission, 
a reward uninterrupted, 
where what was three relives 
singularity,
changing the day's course
back to its first decree. 

A destined modulation from One
back to none, no-one
but You, wide-eyed
that this internal matter
is entirely alike. 
Nothing at all, caught
in different moments,
for we are not mad
and, without exception, 
will spin endlessly the same web.

The plan is firm, the ink dry
and here: an invitation to prostration,
a reminder to the worlds.
