# Distilled

I fell asleep at the top of the stairs
in a perfect patch of sun
and woke up some time later
still here, but utterly stuck.

All I could do was open one eye
about two millimetres wide:
enough to see a dot of dune
behind our house and sun
streaming through the bushes
in a pattern of pulses as leaves
gave lyrics to the wind's song.

A circle of coloured light
streaming a single, endless message:
_"It's all just love, [love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmezIIrFQmY)"_
lying paralysed on the floor,
still at peace
with the tiny slice 
this half-open eye 
gets to see.
