# Mlambomkulu

Do you wonder what it is
that God whispered into this waterfall
which gave it to giggle everlasting glory?
What words of life were woven in this place
and how much wider and more willful
was the Word wrapped in your heart
from where a stream far stronger flows
than even this sacred river
and its straight fall 
into endless sea.
