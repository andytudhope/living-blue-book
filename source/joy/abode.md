# abode

The water waves in wide ripples
across the bay before me, 
mountains in the distance moving too,
sinking from nothing to nothing,
noting their own nakedness
and how they have come to know
thou thyself in cloudless sky.

Abide here, boundless heart,
below bounded waters,
above bare peaks pointing
beyond your perception.

Long, long, long for truth,
then long again until it is
the root of love. 
Let go everything,
limp along with fear 
and hope,
simply believing the Beloved will
not forsake his own blood.
