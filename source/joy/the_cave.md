# The Cave

Feel the moss-shaped angels
on a simple rock ceiling
sing you into imaginary time,
where our sun's rays split cloud
over newly-cultivated land,
consecrated by a golden rise
which winds the whole horizon in reverse,
our implicate order played back
by your slow movements next to a lake,
all our dreams laid out in the still
time undone by passing
what cannot appear in words,
but which smells something like peace
or patience or a play on deliverance
like the painted cattle come to drink,
delighted in the late afternoon
of one more perfect day,
unique and just like all the others.
