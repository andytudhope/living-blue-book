# Cradle Voice

To sit in this rock cradle and watch
waves catch sun as they curl out blue depth
is more than anyone could ask for
or imagine, yet here we are,
eyes wide open as the light
forms diamonds on sea surface
as if to say:

"Here is what you searched for,
and it is the most simple thing;
an afternoon spent witnessing
the fractal rhythm of an ocean
singing along with endless sound.

I made it all for you,
that you might come to love as I do,
a beggar made breathless by abundance
bowing forever, before and after
what is beyond belief,
where even big words like love 
are made little again:

lit up as it is,
this whole and sweet eternity."
