# Eternal Flame

This morning I understood
what really keeps this fire burning,
after pruning this rose bush of desire
then sweeping it up, along with all
my expectations and ambition,
and pushing them into the flames
only to realise that I had to get in too,
my flesh the necessary firelighter
required to engulf it all and reduce it down
to ash and rhythm and an empty sanctum,
no-one left to clean it further:
for who can pretend to wash
what comes before purity?

There is no way to earn paradise,
but experience hell and learn to avoid it:
your path will surely appear.

I jumped into the flames of myself
and water came pouring from desert sky.
That is the truth I can share.
