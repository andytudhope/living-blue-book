# Reverent

"The whole world is a single flower." â€” Sign at the entrance to the Poplar Grove zendo

You burped in front of the Buddha
when dousing our morning candle
and Margie, playfully cross,
clicked her tongue and said,
"Oh, such irreverence!"

So you turned and bowed to her instead,
that same twinkle in your eye.
