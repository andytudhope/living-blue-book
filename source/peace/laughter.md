# Laughter

"Music is all around it, and there the heart partakes of the joy of the Infinite Sea." — Kabîr

---

I died listening to _Al-Haqq_,
happily and with my whole heart:
blown a part of something much bigger,
bewildered to be picked up,
brushed off and slapped hard in the face
for letting go so easily 
such a valuable thing as life.

Now here I am again, 
fumbling for the middle:
giving up and holding on
and hearing all the laughter of those
who have given and gained
this glory outside time.
