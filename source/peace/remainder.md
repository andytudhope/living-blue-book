# Remainder

One drop ran down the open window
and it was more beautiful than any word
I have ever written.

I could write and burn 
ten thousand poems and never 
find it again,
because it is not poetry; 
it is life.
Here, I have made my declaration:

This is what I cannot say,
what only You can hear.

It is done, and now I go to drown in truth. 
Tell no-one I was here, 
only the traceless remains.
