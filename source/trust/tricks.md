# Tricks

The first word my phone suggests
is "hahaha", how wonderful is that?

I came here to write a deep poem
and have ended up chuckling helplessly
at how even technology is tripped up
by the first trickster, turned around
to tell this simple truth:

There is a peace past understanding
that stretches on forever, and it is yours,
as it has been on every Day of Reckoning
since our path was perfected;
peace upon the one who pulled us into it.
