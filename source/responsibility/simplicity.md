# Simplicity

To sing a simple song,
sent as a signed message
as you sat there reciting
your secret with such sincerity
that I could barely even see you
for the light you left behind your story,
vast trails streaked across the living room
as if to speak the truth, to say -
despite the distortions and downright lies -

that this is
what is happening,
that this is
what it feels like,
that this is
what it is and maybe

that's enough.
