# Urvatu'l-Vuthqá

It's wonderful to know these words,
to call the covenant by its correct name
and walk through this world seeing
a way that leads to a tree at the end of time,
watch its leaves teach detachment
as they dance their empty deaths.

No room for doubt as you witness
sun and sea break silence with just one
crashing wave of certainty
in all these changing waters,
decree and destiny already drawn
on the doubly-illuminated surface.

It's seeking you, so you can hear it say:
"Dive in! Dive in and drown in this vast blue
which is your birthright.
There can be no better death,
no better life than that lived here,
utterly free and holy foretold."
