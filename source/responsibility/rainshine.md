# Rainshine

It's electric silence between each fall, 
which can find no translation
but light itself; come to celebrate
the end of three days rain,
turn drops to diamond and draw a rainbow
from the stirred up waves that,
like us, are wide-eyed and full of wonder,
headed for shore and this sunlit shower,
knowing their show stops here,
yet waves will form forever
and, in that - in this -
all we ever needed to say.
