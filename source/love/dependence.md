# Dependence

"Only a Perfect One who is always laughing at the word two can make you know of Love." — [Khwāja Shams-ud-Dīn Muḥammad Ḥāfeẓ-e Shīrāzī](http://www.poetseers.org/the-poetseers/hafiz/hafiz-poems-the-gift/i-have-learned-so-much/)

I need you,
here is the honest truth.

Not just any you,
but this specific nightingale
who read Surat An-Nas with me
and revealed _ithar_, the one
attribute which is purely human.

There is no-one better to dream with,
no-one better to die with.

No-one but One,
followed by these two 
looking for one another
until they too witness perfection
twice over, one eye
looking together for what we most need
so we can give it up and gather
back our separate pieces to sit
quietly outside, eating a few grapes,
relishing the act of living
one life.
