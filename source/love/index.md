"Before there was a trace of this world of men,
I carried the memory of a lock of your hair,
A stray end gathered within me, though unknown." — Bibi Hayati

"Love is itself unmoving,
Only the cause and end of movement,
Timeless, and undesiring
Except in the aspect of time
Caught in the form of limitation
Between un-being and being.
Sudden in a shaft of sunlight
Even while the dust moves
There rises the hidden laughter
Of children in the foliage
Quick now, here, now, always" — T. S. Eliot
