# Divan

This morning it was Rūmī,
after a long dream of sunlight and water,
who unveiled our hearts, set us free
in time to find each other
and sent me to wait between
rain squalls sweeping the beach
and an ocean stirred up by all
the recent storms, dragging me South
so I could see a double rainbow
arcing over our coloured town,
its end right here in the lagoon
where I am left sure:

There is a way, dear one,
from your heart to my heart.
I hear people walking it every day.

Dancing, or dragging their chains,
they come to cry recognition
and call to the one who gathered them,
showered in grace.
