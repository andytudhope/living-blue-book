# Transmission

"The teacher acts as one entrance and the pupil acts as another, and when both doors are open there is a complete emptiness, a complete oneness between the two \[...\]
Although one sees it described in books as 'great bliss' or 'mahamudra' or 'the awakened state of mind' or 'satori', the actual moment is very simple, very direct. It is merely a meeting of two minds. Two minds become one." — Chögyam Trungpa

Yes, old friend, to know
this luminous doom,
to have wandered, lost,
for how many lives,
how many loves left
by the side of bonfires,
buried in plain sight
like the best secret
between us.

So simple, this,
the sadness and joy
and what it is to share
in one silent gesture
the whole thing.

Holy.
