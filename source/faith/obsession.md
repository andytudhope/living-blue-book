# Obsession

Read truth, by permission.

Creation is only to be
in adoration and worship,
for one obsessed with life.

Though we pass through,
truth never moves:
no time, no space.

What is, is beyond all this
and within all this,
so don't deny any of it.

Be enslaved by grace.
There is no escape
from your reflection.

There is only one.
From one, by one,
unto one:

say it!

Sing it, slander it, sip it
deliciously, like the drink of life
this really is.
