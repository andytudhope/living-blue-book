# Coastlines

Here, on the wild coast 
where first we walked;
aquatic apes aching to be 
drowned in what is
beyond myth, mind, metaphor,
even the soft music of an Indian Ocean
which has sung _tat tvam asi_
since before time began,
and will continue, _bismillah_,
long after it ends,
long after that last soul
standing at the edge cries

_Hineni_

Here I am,
a god embodied,
but not how you think:
not this, nor this, nor that.

Not suffering, not pain,
not love, not light,
not grace, not grandeur,
not gratitude, not glory,
not majesty, not music.
Not birth, not death.

Though once we walked together,
barefoot on an endless beach,
bathed in nothing, obliterated
by what is not
this world, waiting
for the breaking wave
and one more chance to chant:

_lā ʾilāha ʾillā llāh_
_lā ʾilāha ʾillā llāh_
_lā ʾilāha ʾillā llāh_
