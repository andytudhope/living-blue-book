<p>“Each person is a carbon copy of the <em>lawḥ maḥfuẓ</em> (guarded tablet). Each of us carries the same copy of consciousness. The copy of Qur’an is in the heart, but we must make an effort to read it. That reading means living it, and that living it is actually unifying the inward and outward.” — Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri</p>
<p>“This is that mystic religion which, though it has nothing in it but that same spirit, that same truth, and that same life, which always was and always must be the religion of all God’s holy angels and saints in heaven, is by the wisdom of this world accounted to be madness.” — <a href="http://www.passtheword.org/William-Law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">William Law</a></p>

<p>“Earth’s the right place for love:<br>I don’t know where it’s likely to go better.<br>I’d like to go by climbing a birch tree,<br>And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk<br>Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,<br>but dipped its top and set me down again.<br>That would be good both going and coming back.<br>One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.” — Robert Frost</p>

<p>“So that one day you realised that what you wanted<br>had already happened long ago and in the dwelling place<br>you had lived in before you began,<br>and that every step along the way, you had carried<br>the heart and the mind and the promise<br>that first set you off and drew you on and that you were<br>more marvelous in your simple wish to find a way<br>than the gilded roofs of any destination you could reach” — David Whyte</p>
<p>“It’s time<br>with all your colours and eternities<br>to free me.” — Mirabai</p>
<p>“We need the awkward truth of poetry. We need its indirect insistence on the magic of listening.<br>[…]<br>We need the voice that speaks to our joys, our childhoods, and to the Gordian knots of our private and national condition.

<p>“For I have known them all already, known them all:<br>Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,<br>I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;<br>I know the voices dying with a dying fall<br>Beneath the music from a farther room.<br>               So how should I presume?” —T. S. Eliot</p>

<p>“One of the functions of art is to give people the words to know their own experience… Storytelling is a tool for knowing who we are and what we want.” — Ursula K. Le Guin</p>
<p>“The most important thing is to explain to people what sound does […] Why is it that there is an emotive quality to sound?  In other words, how to listen: how to attach yourself to the first sound in the hope of staying with it until the end.” — Daniel Barenboim</p>
<p>“I had been drawn into these tones which in their apparent monotony recalled the eternal recurrence of all things existing and knocked at the doors of your own feelings and called forth, step by step, all that had been moving in you without your knowledge . . . laid bare something that had always been there and now became obvious to you with a vividness that made your heart pound […] a rushing of wheels out of eternity into eternity, without measure or limit or goal, a breathless, reckless tightrope-walker’s run over knife-edge precipices, through one eternal present, towards an awareness that was freedom, and power, and beyond all thought. And, suddenly, in the midst of an uprising sweep: a stop and a deadly silence. Brutal. Honest. Clean.” — Muhammad Asad</p>

The rest is always and everywhere silence.” — Aldous Huxley</p>
<p>“It has come to me of late that comparing one man’s work to another’s, naming one greater or lesser, is a wrong approach.

What a marvellous world if all would, — could hold this attitude toward life.” — Edward Weston</p>

<p>“There is no insurmountable solitude. All paths lead to the same goal: to convey to others what we are. And we must pass through solitude and difficulty, isolation and silence in order to reach forth to the enchanted place where we can dance our clumsy dance and sing our sorrowful song — but in this dance or in this song there are fulfilled the most ancient rites of our conscience in the awareness of being human and of believing in a common destiny.” — Pablo Neruda</p>
<p>“The desert is bare and clean and knows no compromise. It sweeps out of the heart of man all the lovely fantasies that could be used as a masquerade for wishful thinking, and thus makes him free to surrender himself to an Absolute that has no image: the farthest of all that is far and yet the nearest of all that is near.” — Muhammad Asad</p>

Free your minds from those overgrown, mountainous imbecilities which hinder your recognition of it, and at once the truth will emerge from amid the pseudo-religious nonsense that has been smothering it: the indubitable, eternal truth inherent in man, which is one and the same in all the great religions of the world.” — Leo Tolstoy to Mahatma Ghandi</p>

<p>“There are a people, now forgotten, who discovered while others were yet barbarians, the elements of the arts and sciences.

<p>“The future can be changed. We are all brothers and sisters, the children of one father and one mother. Treat children and animals with kindness, and pass this wisdom on to generations to come and I assure you there will come a time when our grandchildren, or our great grandchildren, will live in a world of beauty and harmony. And they will hear a far-off music, a beautiful, cosmic music, that will lift them beyond all fear, suffering and limitation, into a universal brotherhood, beyond this little world and its fearful dreams. That music is the Song of the Stars. Indaba.” — Baba Credo Mutwa</p>

<p>“Longing is a living prayer of love […] In the ocean of love’s longing, the ego is doomed. The primal cry of the soul takes the lover beyond this world and the next, straight to Him who is our deepest desire […] The secret of love’s union is the He unites with Himself in the heart of His lover. The lover who gives himself to longing participates in this mystery […] Love is both the longing for union and the bliss of union.

Why are You asking me where<br>Your lovers live?”<br>And the Beloved replied, “Indeed, Hafiz, I do know everything.<br>But it is fun playing dumb once in a while. And I love intimate chat<br>And the warmth of your heart’s fire.” — Khwāja Shams-ud-Dīn Muḥammad Ḥāfeẓ-e Shīrāzī</p>
<p>“It is this sort of optimism that animates the book — optimism that feels not human but geologic, more kindred to the <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/05/14/jane-hirshfield-optimism-kelli-anderson-animation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimism of a tree</a>, rooted in deep time, in strata of cultures and civilizations who all lived and died, hoped and despaired, foraged for meaning, dwelt in dreams; the optimism of uncertainty, the kind Václav Havel recognized as the willingness “<a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/09/22/vaclav-havel-hope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to work for something because it is good, not just because it stands a chance to succeed</a>.”” — Maria Popova</p>
<p>“We should resist inertial thinking; indeed, we should urge its opposite – deep time as a radical perspective, provoking us to action not apathy. For to think in deep time can be a means not of escaping our troubled present, but rather of re-imagining it; countermanding its quick greeds and furies with older, slower stories of making and unmaking. At its best, a deep time awareness might help us see ourselves as part of a web of gift, inheritance and legacy stretching over millions of years past and millions to come, bringing us to consider what we are leaving behind for the epochs and beings that will follow us.” — Robert Macfarlane</p>
<p>“This is the starting point to perfecting the relationship between action and knowledge. The soul only sees perfection at all times. The self tries to unfold perfection through action. With spiritual wisdom, the self will witness perfection through the soul’s lens. At the end, as in the beginning, there is only the ever perfect divine cosmic soul, the source of all knowledge and action and the creation’s desire for ever-lasting perfection. God is beyond it all and yet all is covered by his essence.” — Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri</p>
<p>“Except for the point, the still point,<br>There would be no dance, and there is only the dance.<br>I can only say, there we have been: but I cannot say where.<br>And I cannot say, how long, for that is to place it in time.<br>The inner freedom from the practical desire,<br>The release from action and suffering, release from the inner<br>And the outer compulsion, yet surrounded<br>By a grace of sense, a white light still and moving<br>[…]<br>To be conscious is not to be in time<br>But only in time can the moment in the rose-garden,<br>The moment in the arbour where the rain beat,<br>The moment in the draughty church at smokefall<br>Be remembered; involved with past and future.<br>Only through time time is conquered.” — T. S. Eliot</p>
<p>“You say you’ve unrolled the carpet of time,<br>step then beyond life itself and reason,<br>till you arrive at God’s command.” — Hakim Abul-Majd Majdūd ibn Ādam Sanā’ī Ghaznavi</p>
<p>“Only god doesn’t pain me today.<br>Is it because today doesn’t exist?” — Roberto Juarroz </p>
<p>“The Outer and the Inner, the I and the World, are to him not opposite - and mutually opposed - entities, but only different aspects of an unchanging present; his life is not dominated by secret fears; and whenever he does things, he does them because outward necessity and not a desire for inner security demands action. In result, he has not progressed in material achievement as rapidly as the Westerner - but he has kept his soul together.” — Muhammad Asad</p>
<p>“Then there is no achieving, no ladder to climb; there is only the first step and the first step is the everlasting step.” — Jiddu Krishnamurti</p>
<p>“So, instead of trying to pull ourselves up by our bootlaces, let’s take off our shoes altogether, feel the earth beneath our feet and the sun in our hair. Then, when we step forward with helping hands, we will leave no trace.” — Anthony Osler</p>
<p>“The melody of love swells forth, and the rhythm of love’s detachment beats the time.” — Kabîr</p>
<p>“Eternal life is the time of union,<br>Because time, for me, hath no place there.<br>Life is the vessels, union the clear draught in them.” — Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī</p>
<p>“There love and detachment, bondage and freedom, joy and pain play by turns upon the soul; and it is from their conflict that the Unstruck Music of the Infinite proceeds.” — Kabîr</p>
<p>“The really important kind of freedom involves attention. And awareness. And discipline. And being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, in myriad, petty little unsexy ways, every day.” — David Foster Wallace</p>
<p>“Freedom from need is a great form of material wealth. Freedom from want is a great form of spiritual wealth. Where they intersect is for each of us the cross we choose to bear.” — Joseph Lamport</p>
<p>“Mara never crosses the path of those who are virtuous,<br>who live without thoughtlessness,<br>and who are liberated by true knowledge.” — Buddha</p>
<p>“And if the Wine you drink, the Lip you press<br>End in what All begins and ends in–Yes;<br>Think then you are To-day what Yesterday<br>You were–To-morrow You shall not be less.” — Omar Khayyam</p>
<p>“Wonder is the heaviest element in the periodic table of the heart. Even a tiny piece of it can stop time.” — Diane Ackerman</p>
<p>“Wonder,<br>A garden among the flames!<br>My heart can take on any form:<br>A meadow for gazelles,<br>A cloister for monks,<br>For the idols, sacred ground,<br>Ka’ba for the circling pilgrim,<br>The tables of the Torah,<br>The scrolls of the Qur’an.<br>My creed is Love;<br>Wherever its caravan turns along the way,<br>That is my belief,<br>My faith.” — Ibn ʿArabī</p>
<p>“Every transient reality depends upon the constant truth. Every shadow depends upon light […] The determined seeker keeps only one appointment: timeless bliss.” — Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri</p>
<p>“The devout seeker is he who mingles in his heart the double currents of love and detachment” — Kabîr</p>
<p>“To bring together the extreme gravity of the question with the extreme lightness of the form — that has always been my ambition.” — Milan Kundera</p>
<p>“We are, at birth, born into a condition of poetry. Birth is a poetic condition: it is spirit becoming flesh. Death is also a poetic condition: it is flesh becoming spirit again. It is the miracle of a circle completed, the unheard melody of a life returning to unmeasured silence.<br>Between birth and death what are our daily moments but a double condition that is primarily poetic: the odd conjunction between inner and outer, between that inner sense of timelessness and the outer evidence of transience?” — Ben Okri</p>
<p>“Now like a radiant sky creature<br>God keeps opening.</p>
<p>God keeps opening<br>Inside of Me.” — Khwāja Shams-ud-Dīn Muḥammad Ḥāfeẓ-e Shīrāzī</p>
<p>“I sent my Soul through the Invisible,<br>Some letter of that After-life to spell:<br>And by and by my Soul return’d to me,<br>And answer’d “I Myself am Heav’n and Hell:”<br>Heav’n but the Vision of fulfill’d Desire,<br>And Hell the Shadow from a Soul on fire,<br>Cast on the Darkness into which Ourselves,<br>So late emerged from, shall so soon expire.” — Omar Khayyam</p>
<p>“Of course I wake up finally<br>thinking, how wonderful to be who I am,<br>made out of earth and water,<br>my own thoughts, my own fingerprints -<br>all that glorious, temporary stuff.”  — Mary Oliver</p>
<p>“We shall show them Our wonders on all horizons and in their selves, until it becomes obvious to them that it is the Truth. Does it not suffice that your Lord is a witness of all things?” — Qur’an 41:53</p>
<p>“From man’s perspective in this intricate game of love,<br>It is so easy to become confused and think you are the doer.<br>But from God’s infinite certainty,<br>He always Knows that He is the only one<br>Who should ever be put on trial.” — Khwāja Shams-ud-Dīn Muḥammad Ḥāfeẓ-e Shīrāzī</p>
<p>“For him the world is non-existent, and he will not study the unreal; like the compass he circles ever round a point, on which his thoughts, actions, and very being depend: he cannot stray from his course any more than a star can leave its orbit. Hence all mystical writings are the record of one spiritual experience and are pervaded by a single overpowering emotion. The language of all mystics is the same. How often do Law, Emerson, and Shelley remind us of the Masnavi!” — Reynold Nicholson</p>
<p>“A conjuror came visitng with rabbits up his sleeve<br>A yogi put us on the mat and showed us how to breathe<br>Franciscan monks walked up and down in robes with knotted cords<br>We had no doubt they ambled in the footsteps of their Lord<br>There were Rabbis in the long drop and Sufis in the tree house<br>Who told us they would give their lives to liberate and free us<br>Archbishop Desmond Tutu and his friend the Dalai Lama<br>Came to wash our dishes and check up on our karma<br>We live so far they said that is was difficult to find us<br>But they teased each other, laughed at us and laid a trail of kindness” — Anthony Osler</p>
<p>“I was snow and melted away, so that the earth drank me up,<br>Till I became one mist of soul and mounted to the sky.” — Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī</p>
<p>“If I adore You out of fear of Hell, burn me in Hell!<br>If I adore you out of desire for Paradise,<br>Lock me out of Paradise.<br>But if I adore you for Yourself alone,<br>Do not deny to me Your eternal beauty.” — Rābiʿa Basri</p>
<p>“If I seem a little bizarre, remember the wild profusion of my inheritance . . . perhaps, if one wishes to remain an individual in the midst of the teeming multitudes, one must make oneself grotesque.” — Salman Rushdie</p>
<p>“And we probably have some idea or expectation. That is natural and lovely; it is what we have brought with us. It also doesn’t matter at all. Because our practice is not about confirming or contradicting anything we think; it is about stepping into something new and unknown, something for which we are truly unprepared — the practice of something shining, of waking up.<br>[…]<br>We will practice as if our hair is on fire. And when we find ourselves lost in inattention, distraction or judgement, we will wake up and start from there — from right there, inside our lostness […] for there is something wide and boundless in which we live, in which we cannot be lost.” — Anthony Osler</p>
<p>“For me, it is looking at the night for so long that my eyes ache and I’m stuck seeing stars for hours afterwards, watching the way the ocean sways itself to sleep, or as the sky washes itself in colors for which I know I will never have the words — a world made from layers of rock and fossil and glittered imaginings that keep tripping me up, demanding I pay attention to one leaf at a time, ensuring I can never pick up quite where I left off.” — Ella Frances Sanders</p>
<p>“I met a woman<br>once and asked her where love had led her.<br>“Fool, there’s no destination to arrive at.<br>Loved one and lover and love are infinite.”” — Farīd ud-Dīn ʿAṭṭār</p>
<p>“I don’t expect them to speak, and they don’t.<br>If being so beautiful isn’t enough, what<br>could they possibly say?” — Mary Oliver</p>
<p>“There is silence; but a silence that breathes with the soft breathing of the sea and, in the thin shrill noise of a cricket, insistently, incessantly harps on the fact of its own deep perfection. Far away, the passage of a train is like a long caress, moving gently, with an inexorable gentleness, across the warm living body of the night.” — Aldous Huxley</p>
<p>“So, then, if you can’t ever end things neatly, can’t ever put them back quite the way you found them, surely the alternative is to remain stubbornly carbonated with possibility, to never rest from your rotation. To keep assembling stories between us, stories about how everything was everything, about how much we loved.” — Ella Frances Sanders</p>
<p>“To celebrate, or to dwindle into dullness, seems to me the law at work here.” — Ben Okri</p>
<p>“Hold this moment forever, I tell myself; it may never come again.” — Pico Iyer</p>
<p>“as when some Man apart<br>Answers aloud the Question in his Heart<br>‘The Sun of my Perfection is a Glass<br>Wherein from <em>Seeing</em> into <em>Being</em> pass<br>All who, reflecting as reflected see<br>Themselves in Me, and Me in Them: not Me,<br>But all of Me that a contracted Eye<br>Is comprehensive of Infinity:<br>Nor yet <em>Themselves</em>: no Selves, but of The All<br>Fractions, from which they split and whither fall.<br>As Water lifted from the Deep, again<br>Falls back in individual Drops of Rain<br>Then melts into the Universal Main.<br>All you have been, and seen, and done, and thought,<br>Not <em>You</em> but _I_, have seen and been and wrought”  — Farīd ud-Dīn ʿAṭṭār</p>
<p>“Today we weep, tonight we dance. There is no conclusion to be reached about all this. Just coming across such delight and having our hearts opened is precious beyond compare.” — Anthony Osler</p>
<p>“O spirit, make thy head in search and seeking like the water of a stream.<br>And O reason, to gain eternal life tread everlastingly the way of death.<br>Keep God in remembrance till self is forgotten,<br>That you may be lost in the Called, without distraction of caller and call.” — Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī</p>
<p>“And serve Allah and do not associate any thing with Him and be good to your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ausD8Z422as&amp;lc=UgzuSQrkt4xR9fsXPhh4AaABAg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parents</a>.” — Qur’an 4:36</p>

<p>“Behold, We shall cast upon thee a weighty word.” — Qur’an 73:5</p>
<p>“Please God, that we avoid the land of denial, and advance into the ocean of acceptance, so that we may perceive, with an eye purged from all conflicting elements, the worlds of unity and diversity, of variation and oneness, of limitation and detachment, and wing our flight unto the highest and innermost sanctuary of the inner meaning of the Word of God.” — Baha’u’llah</p>
<p>“Certainly, it is a decisive word” — Qur’an 86:13</p>
<p>“The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,<br>Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit<br>Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,<br>Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.” — Omar Khayyam</p>
<p>“It can only be known by heart and soul, not through mind and intellect […] The religion of God is abandonment unto God.” — Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri</p>
<p>“I am alone; make me your single goal -<br>My presence is sufficient for your soul;<br>I am your God, your one necessity -<br>With every breath you breathe, remember Me.” — Farīd ud-Dīn ʿAṭṭār</p>
<p>“So plunge into the truth, find out who the Teacher is,<br>Believe in the Great Sound!” — Kabîr</p>
<p>“We, this people, on a small and lonely planet<br>Traveling through casual space<br>Past aloof stars, across the way of indifferent suns<br>To a destination where all signs tell us<br>It is possible and imperative that we learn<br>A brave and startling truth<br>[…]<br>When we come to it<br>We must confess that we are the possible<br>We are the miraculous, the true wonder of this world<br>That is when, and only when<br>We come to it.” — Maya Angelou</p>
<p>“Come you lost Atoms to your Centre draw,<br>And be the Eternal Mirror that you saw:<br>Rays that have wander’d into Darkness wide<br>Return and back into your Sun subside.” — Farīd ud-Dīn ʿAṭṭār</p>
<p>“One day the sun admitted,<br>I am just a shadow.<br>I wish I could show you the infinite incandescence<br>That has cast my brilliant image!<br>I wish I could show you,<br>When you are lonely or in darkness,<br>The astonishing Light<br>Of your own Being!” — Khwāja Shams-ud-Dīn Muḥammad Ḥāfeẓ-e Shīrāzī</p>
<p>“We shall make you read so as not to forget.” — Qur’an 87:6</p>
<p>“True reading is a creative act. It means seeing first; and then a subsequent act of the imagination. Higher reading ought to be a subject in the universities of the future. As we read, so we are.” — Ben Okri</p>
<p>“The highest human achievement is synchronising outer rationality with inner intuition and insight. It requires reading the map of human creation, understanding it, and following it carefully and attentively until the reader and that which is being read unify.” — Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri</p>
<p>“This was my master’s way. He not only knew how to read the great book of nature, but also knew the way monks read the books of Scripture, and how they thought through them […] His explanation, moreover, seemed to me at that point so obvious that my humiliation at not having discovered it by myself was surpassed only by my pride at now being a sharer of it, and I was almost congratulating myself on my insight. Such is the power of truth that, like good, it is its own propagator.” — Umberto Eco</p>
<p>“A quiet academic career did not attract me. I felt a yearning to come into more intimate grips with life, to enter it without any of those carefully contrived, artificial defences which security-minded people love to build up around themselves; and I wanted to find by myself an approach to the spiritual order of things which, I knew, must exist.” — Muhammad Asad</p>
<p>“There is no greater gift a people can be given than that they live a life touched with fable.” — Ben Okri</p>
<p>“He just likes to hang around, dozing, smiling, sniffing the incense, watching our coming and going. It makes me happy to have him here; a reminder of our commitment to waking up, and an honouring of those who have made this commitment before us. When the children have their weekends here, the boys sleep in the zendo, which they call the China Church. One night Alpheus went up to the statue in the middle of the night and spoke to the Buddha in his mock-Mandarin; when the story got out in the morning, Margie asked Alpheus if the Buddha had answered him.  ‘Oh yes,’ he said, ‘he said to me, “Hello Alpheus, you are a big handsome boy.’” — Anthony Osler</p>
<p>“Buddhism is perhaps the only religion which is not based on the revelation of God nor on faith and devotion to God or gods of any kind. This does not mean that Buddha was an atheist or a heretic. He never argued theological or philosophical doctrines at all. He went straight to the heart of the matter, namely how to see the truth.” — Chögyam Trungpa</p>
<p>“The only doctrine that I have in music and music-making is that it basically comes out of the nature of paradox: that you have to have the extremes; that you have to find a way to put the extremes together, not necessarily by diminishing the extremity of each one, but to form the art of transition.” — Daniel Barenboim</p>
<p>“And in that moment, he was finally able to accept it all. In the deepest recesses of his soul, Tsukuru Tanazaki understood. One heart is not connected to another through harmony alone. They are, instead, linked deeply through their wounds. Pain linked to pain, fragility to fragility. There is no silence without a cry of grief, no forgiveness without bloodshed, no acceptance without a passage through acute loss. That is what lies at the root of true harmony.” — Haruko Murakami</p>
<p>“Because this unfamiliar world is so entirely different from all that you have known at home; because it offers so much that is strikingly strange in image and sound, it brushes you sometimes, if you permit yourself to be attentive, with a momentary remembrance of things long known and long forgotten: those intangible realities of your own life. And when this breath of remembrance reaches you from beyond the abyss that separates your world from that other, that unfamiliar one, you ask yourself whether it is not perhaps herein - and only herein - that the meaning of all wandering lies: to become aware of the strangeness of the world around you and thereby reawaken to your own, personal, forgotten reality.” — Muhammad Asad</p>
<p>“Muhammad must have sensed the full weight of revolution achieved, and known that to realize a dream was only to wake up to a more complex reality.” — Lesley Hazelton”</p>
<p>“Everyone, regardless, always, of everything. Not to mention the existential sorrow we all might be afflicted with, which is that we, and what we love, will soon be annihilated. Which sounds more dramatic than it might. Let me just say dead. Is this sorrow, of which our impending being no more might be the foundation, the great wilderness? Is sorrow the true wild? And if it is — and if we join them — your wild to mine — what’s that? For joining, too, is a kind of annihilation. What if we joined our sorrows, I’m saying. I’m saying: What if that is joy?” — Ross Gay</p>
<p>“And killing the Buddha means putting myself aside and taking into my heart whoever is in front of me.” — Anthony Osler</p>
<p>“It had to teach her to think of love as a state of grace: not the means to anything but the alpha and omega, an end in itself.” — Gabriel García Márquez</p>
<p>“If the eye of the heart is open, in each atom there will be one hundred secrets.” — Farīd ud-Dīn ʿAṭṭār</p>
<p>“Seams have a tendency to come apart with time — you and the universe are the same in this way, which makes for a delicately overwhelming struggle.” — Ella Frances Sanders</p>
<p>“You ask for a few words of comfort and guidance,<br>I quickly kneel at your side offering you this whole book as a gift.<br>You ache with loneliness one night so much you weep and I say,<br>Here’s a rope, tie it around me,<br>Hafiz will be your companion for life.” — Khwāja Shams-ud-Dīn Muḥammad Ḥāfeẓ-e Shīrāzī</p>
<p>“He had been touched into life by the ancient myth of the superman and by the brilliant angel of the beautiful darkness. A darkness that was, in truth, a new light.” — Ben Okri</p>
<p>“Art invites us to take the journey beyond price, beyond costs into bearing witness to the world as it is and as it should be. Art invites us to know beauty and to solicit it from even the most tragic of circumstances. Art reminds us that we belong here. And if we serve, we last.” — Toni Morrison</p>
<p>“Beauty in art: the suddenly-kindled light of the the never-before-said. This light that radiates from the great novels time can never dim, for human existence is perpetually being forgotten by man, and thus the novelists’ discoveries, however old they may be, will never cease to astonish us.” — Milan Kundera</p>
<p>“He wonders what makes the light so strong. Why can he just see white when he looks into it? Where are the greens and reds that dance across his clothes? He looks at his body — it is drenched in color. His arms, his hands, his legs, are luminous, brilliant. He feels the brilliance being absorbed through his skin, saturating his flesh, flowing through his blood all the way to his fingertips. He starts radiating brilliance himself. Brilliance that illuminates each row of empty seats, brilliance that paints each wall a blinding white, brilliance that turns the curtains into sheets of light. As Vishnu watches, the entire theater becomes incandescent. He looks down at himself, but he can no longer tell where the light ends and his body begins.” — Manil Suri</p>
<p>“And we know that what we have glimpsed is not magic, or art, or enchantment. We know in some obscure way, that the kingdom is real.” — Ben Okri</p>
<p>“Ah, my friend, the family treasure does not enter through the front gate; it rises in the heart and fills heaven and earth.” — Yen T’ou</p>
<p>“Let’s toast<br>Every rung we’ve climbed on Evolution’s ladder.<br>Whisper, “I love you! I love you!”<br>To the whole mad world.” — Khwāja Shams-ud-Dīn Muḥammad Ḥāfeẓ-e Shīrāzī</p>
<p>“and everything on this earth, little dreamer, little dreamer<br>of the new world, holy, every rain drop and sand grain and blade<br>of grass worthy of gasp and joy and love” — Ross Gay</p>
<p>“Sing away so that you recall the original song, until you are with the Songmaker and even songs do not matter anymore.” — Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri</p>
<p>“This is how we find ourselves once more in each other’s shoes. We walk, we work, we weep, and we fall asleep at the end of the day without illusion or regret. Now the question is no longer ‘Where can I run to?’ but ‘How can I live here?’ Not, ‘Who is to blame?’ but ‘How can I help?’ And, finally, in a voice so ordinary we hardly hear it, ‘Come inside. Would you like a cup of tea?’<br>[…]<br>The treasure of contentment with what-is is already here, filling our life, and now everything is shining — you, me, the innkeeper, the ashes in the fireplace. Yen T’ou’s kindness untied the knot in Hseuh Feng’s chest and opened his eyes.<br>[…]<br>Just this. It is a special kind of friendship, and completely ordinary. It wraps its arms around us, it challenges us to stay awake.” — Anthony Osler</p>
<p>“It was all for souls to grow<br>May it always have been so<br>Thy splendor brightly aglow<br>And so we say, may it be so” — Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī</p>
<p>“Awake, my dear.<br>Be kind to your sleeping heart.<br>Take it out into the vast fields of Light and let it breathe.<br>Say, “Love, give me back my wings.<br>Lift me, lift me nearer.”<br>Say to the sun and moon, say to our dear Friend,<br>“I will take You up now, Beloved,<br>On that wonderful Dance You promised!”” — Khwāja Shams-ud-Dīn Muḥammad Ḥāfeẓ-e Shīrāzī</p>
<p>“It is impossible to say just what I mean!” — T. S. Eliot</p>
<p>“It is the deference that moves her, that recognition that language can never live up to life once and for all. Nor should it. Language can never “pin down” slavery, genocide, war. Nor should it yearn for the arrogance to be able to do so. Its force, its felicity is in its reach toward the ineffable.<br>[…]<br>We die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do language. That may be the measure of our lives.” — Toni Morrison</p>
<p>“When the Day came —<br>The Day I had lived and died for —<br>The Day that is not in any calendar —<br>Clouds heavy with love<br>Showered me with wild abundance.<br>Inside me, my soul was drenched.<br>Around me, even the desert grew green.” — Kabîr</p>
<p>“Nor I, nor thou, nor God, nor man. The “I”<br>Has All become, the All is “I” and Bliss.<br>Know thou art That, Sannyasin bold! Say –<br>“Om Tat Sat, Om!”” — Swami Vivekananda</p>
<p>“By precept and by example, the Avatar teaches that this transforming knowledge is possible, that all sentient beings are called to it and that, sooner or later, in one way or another, all must finally come to it.” — Aldous Huxley</p>
<p>“When the traveller on the path has completed<br>the circuit of return to separation, then his last point as man is<br>joined to the first of the Real.” — Shaykh Sa’d ud-Dīn Mahmūd Shabistārī</p>
<p>“And I, infinitesimal being,<br>drunk with the great starry<br>void,<br>likeness, image of<br>mystery,<br>I felt myself a pure part<br>of the abyss,<br>I wheeled with the stars,<br>my heart broke free on the open sky” — Pablo Neruda</p>
<p>“I will gather all people into well-being<br>     Never again will they be divided or abased<br>Take out my hidden treasure<br>     Realize my tidings<br>          my readiness,<br>          my imminent rising<br>I will rise and the stars will gather around me<br>I will bring sun and moon together<br>I will enter every dwelling<br>“Peace to you,” they will greet me<br>“And to you, peace,” I will reply<br>At my beckon, the hour will rise<br>I am the Almighty, the Compassionate.” — Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Jabbar ibn al-Hasan al-Niffarī</p>
<p>“…and you too have come<br>into the world to do this, to go easy, to be filled<br>with light, and to shine.” — Mary Oliver</p>
<p>“The hereafter encompasses the ‘here’ and the purpose of life is to evolve and realise the ever-perfect moment here, now and after. There has been nothing other than cascading divine light producing an infinite variety of shadows, all pointing to the ONE essence worthy of adoration and worship. To witness the light of the ONE is to witness only perfection.<br>We understand this revealed knowledge once we have been exposed to it because we all share in higher consciousness […] His program is that of participative evolution.” — Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri</p>

<p>“Whoever has sought Me has found Me. Whoever has found Me has come to know Me. Whoever has known Me has loved Me. Whoever has loved Me I have slain. Whomever I have slain the payment of the blood money is on Me, and I will Myself be the payment for the blood money that I owe.” — <em>Hadith Qudsi</em></p>
